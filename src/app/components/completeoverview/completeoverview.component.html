                            PRICE CALCULATIONS. If this Contract includes Goods and related Bathroom Remodeling Services
                            sold on a LUMP SUM BASIS. The Price includes the total amount of Goods required by Re-Bath
                            to fulfill the Contract (including surplus materials and overages) (together the “Estimated
                            Product”) and the Bathroom Remodeling Services required based upon this total amount of
                            Goods. For instance, a 120 square foot room may require 140 square feet of carpet, and the
                            Price would include Bathroom Remodeling Services based upon the 140 square feet of carpet.
                            The total amount of Estimated Product is based upon the total Goods recommended by the
                            Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor, based on the Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor's
                            assessment of unique characteristics of Your project. If any usable Goods are left over,
                            Re-Bath may, at its discretion, initiate a Price adjustment. Re-Bath will not adjust the
                            Total Contract Amount for the related Bathroom Remodeling Services. By signing this Contract
                            You acknowledge You are aware of Your project area measurements and the amount of Estimated
                            Product, and that the Estimated Product may exceed Your actual project area. </div>

                            LEAD SAFE INFORMATION. Federal and applicable state laws require that You be provided with a
                            lead hazard information pamphlet such as the Renovate Right: Important Lead Hazard
                            Information for Families, Child Care Providers and Schools. By signing this Contract, You
                            acknowledge having received a copy of this information pamphlet before work began informing
                            You of the potential risk of the lead hazard exposure from renovation activity performed in
                            Your dwelling unit or facility. A copy of the pamphlet is available at the following

                            ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. This Contract provides that You and Re-Bath will resolve all claims
                            by BINDING ARBITRATION. You and Re-Bath GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to enforce this
                            Contract (EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to SMALL CLAIMS COURT). A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR
                            will determine Re-Bath and Your rights and NOT a judge or jury. You and Re-Bath are entitled
                            to a FAIR HEARING. BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES
                            APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are
                            subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. FOR MORE DETAILS: Review the sections titled

                            is an independent contractor and is not under the supervision or control of Re-Bath.
                            Bathroom Remodeling Services do not include architectural or engineering services. Re-Bath
                            reserves the right to terminate or rescind this Contract if Re-Bath decides that any portion
                            of the job is beyond the scope of the Bathroom Remodeling Services that Re-Bath originally
                            contemplated.

                            3. CHANGE ORDERS. Change orders are also referred to as Work Order Changes or WOC. Any
                            changes to the Goods and/or Bathroom Remodeling Services, including but not limited to
                            changes necessitated by undisclosed, unidentified or unforeseen conditions on the site
                            ("Undisclosed Conditions"), are subject to a written Change Order, which shall specify the
                            change in scope and any adjustment to the Total Contract Amount, which will be reflected in
                            the Due Upon Completion payment. Neither Re-Bath nor Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor
                            shall have any obligation to remediate any such conditions and, at its discretion, Re-Bath
                            may immediately discontinue the Bathroom Remodeling or ask for a Change Order. Neither
                            Re-Bath nor Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor will remediate any mold, asbestos or
                            lead-based paint and are not responsible for any delays caused by events beyond either
                            party’s control, including but not limited to acts of nature, governmental actions, delivery
                            delays, or delays caused by third parties, labor strikes, project financing, incorrect
                            information provided by You or Your non-compliance with this Contract. Change orders must be
                            submitted in writing or via email or text message.

                        <div>
                            4. GOODS. Title to Goods does not pass to You and remains the property of Re-Bath until
                            Goods are installed in Your home, building, or on Your property. You agree that the Contract
                            is being offered for the Total Contract Amount and that any surplus materials upon
                            completion of the Bathroom Remodeling Services are not Your property and, if instructed by
                            Re-Bath, such surplus materials shall be returned to Re-Bath by the Re-Bath Installer or
                            Sub-contractor. Upon request from You at the time of job completion, Re-Bath, in its
                            discretion, may allow all or part of the unused, receipted surplus materials to be retained
                            by You.
                        </div>

                            5. LICENSES, PERMITS, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor
                            will obtain any and all licenses, registrations, certifications, and permits (“Local
                            Requirements”) necessary to perform the Bathroom Remodeling Services at the Project Address,
                            unless otherwise required by law or where Re-Bath elects to use a third-party service. You
                            agree to pay any fees associated with the Local Requirements and to cooperate in any
                            required inspection or permitting process. The Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor, and not
                            Re-Bath, is responsible for performing the Bathroom Remodeling Services in compliance with
                            applicable safety rules, building codes, zoning ordinances, and other regulations (“Local
                            Regulations”). You are responsible for any violations of the Local Regulations that exist at
                            the time You sign this Contract. This Contract creates no obligation to correct these
                            pre-existing violations. Any change in the Local Regulations may require a Change Order and
                            may result in an increase in the Total Contract Amount. Neither Re-Bath nor Re-Bath
                            Installer or Sub-contractor will perform any additional work after completion of the
                            Bathroom Remodeling Services due to changes in the Local Regulations.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            6. TERMINATION. If You breach this Contract or decline a reasonable Change Order request,
                            Re-Bath may immediately terminate this Contract without further obligation. In the event of
                            such termination, You agree to pay Re-Bath the costs of materials, labor, expenses, and
                            services provided by Re-Bath in connection with the Bathroom Remodeling Services through the
                            date of termination, plus any other amounts set forth in this Contract or allowed under
                            applicable law. If terminated or rescinded, Re-Bath has no obligation to return the Project
                            Address to the original condition. If Re-Bath terminates or rescinds the contract before
                            delivering Goods or beginning the Bathroom Remodeling Services, then Re-Bath will return the
                            portion of the Total Contract Amount paid by You without further costs or obligation to You
                            or Re-Bath.

                            7. YOUR WARRANTY TO Re-Bath AGAINST VIOLATIONS OF EASEMENTS, COVENANTS, AND THIRD PARTY
                            RIGHTS. You warrant that performance of the Bathroom Remodeling Services will not violate
                            any existing real property easement, covenant, historic district regulations, homeowner's
                            association rule or rights of third parties holding an interest in the Project Address or
                            otherwise, and that You have the rights and authority to enter into this Contract.

                        <div>
                            8. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES. You agree:
                            a) To Pay Re-Bath or Lowe’s Home Improvement or other party if authorized in writing by
                            Re-Bath for any Bathroom Remodeling Services, even if Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor
                            provides a new Contract or Change Order for your review and signature. This Contract is
                            solely between You and Re-Bath.
                            b) To Locate Lines and Hazards. Before Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor begins Bathroom
                            Remodeling Services, You will identify and mark the location of utility lines, for example
                            electrical, plumbing, and gas lines, and property lines that could impact the Bathroom
                            Remodeling Services. Prior to the Bathroom Remodeling, You will identify any pre-existing
                            physical or environmental hazards, building code violations or other legal encumbrances that
                            could affect the Bathroom Remodeling Services. You are responsible for any delays or
                            interference to the Bathroom Remodeling caused by You or any third party under Your
                            direction or control.
                            c) To Ensure Compliance with Smoke Alarm and Carbon Monoxide Detector Requirements. Prior to
                            the start of the Bathroom Remodeling Services, You will ensure the Project Address has all
                            necessary carbon monoxide detectors and smoke alarms (“Detectors”) needed for the Re-Bath
                            Installer or Sub-contractor to obtain the necessary permits and complete the Bathroom
                            Remodeling Services. You are solely responsible for the proper number, placement, type,
                            functioning, operation, Bathroom Remodeling, testing, as per the manufacturers’
                            specifications, and maintenance of any Detectors required by Local Regulations. Failure to
                            meet Federal, state or local Detector requirements, if any, will be considered an
                            Undisclosed Condition.
                            d) To Provide a Safe and Proper Working Environment. Before and during the Bathroom
                            Remodeling Services, You will ensure that work areas are free of vermin, pre-existing
                            physical or environmental hazards, and violations of Local Regulations. You will allow the
                            Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor to have access to work areas and restrooms. You will
                            provide climate control, where applicable, and electricity to the work areas. You agree not
                            to allow unattended minors at the Project Address during the Bathroom Remodeling Services.
                            You agree to control and keep pets away from work areas. You agree to keep posted permits on
                            display at all times. If You or someone You control interferes with the Bathroom Remodeling
                            Services, Re-Bath may charge You for storage, transportation, or other resulting charges.
                            e) To Sign the Certificate of Completion. You will sign a Completion Certificate upon
                            satisfactory completion of the Bathroom Remodeling Services.
                            f) Not to Assign or Transfer this Contract. You cannot give Your rights under this Contract
                            to anyone else. g) To Promptly Notify Re-Bath of a Claim. If you have a claim that is in any
                            way related to this Contract, You must make that claim to Re-Bath within thirty (30)
                            calendar days of when you knew or should have known of a problem. Re-Bath will attempt
                            resolution of any claim(s) within sixty (60) calendar days of receiving Your notice. Re-Bath
                            will allow Limited Warranty transfers on a case by case basis to a new home owner within 1
                            year of completion of this Contract. “Completion” refers to the completion of remodeling,
                            customer signature on Certificate of Completion and full payment received.
                            h) That You Are Responsible If You Choose to Help. IF YOU CHOOSE TO HELP, YOU ASSUME THE
                            RISK AND THE FULL LIABILITY OF PHYSICALLY ASSISTING WITH DELIVERY OF THE GOODS OR WITH
                            PERFORMANCE OF THE Bathroom Remodeling SERVICES.

                        <div>
                            9. LIMITED WARRANTY. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, Re-Bath WARRANTS THE
                            WORKMANSHIP OF THE Bathroom Remodeling SERVICES FOR ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE COMPLETION DATE
                            (THE "WARRANTY PERIOD") UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN DESCRIPTION OF LIMITED LIFETIME
                            WARRANTY GIVEN TO CUSTOMER PRE OR POST COMPLETION OF CONTRACT. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER
                            DAMAGE CAUSED BY ACTS OF GOD, Bathroom Remodeling OR REPAIRS MADE BY PERSONS OTHER THAN
                            Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor, OR ABUSE, MISUSE, NEGLECT OR NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.
                            GOODS ARE COVERED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE MANUFACTURER’S WARRANTY, IF ANY. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY
                            GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.
                            Re-Bath WARRANTY FOR Bathroom Remodeling SERVICES IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS
                            OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
                            FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. For any claim related to this Contract, You can only seek
                            recourse from Re-Bath or the Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor; no parent or affiliate of
                            Re-Bath shall have any liability under this Contract. You must give Re-Bath written notice
                            within the Warranty Period of any warranty claim. Your only remedy for a warranty claim is
                            either (i) for Re-Bath to have the Bathroom Remodeling Services performed again, including
                            any necessary repair and replacement of Goods, to correct the defective Bathroom Remodeling
                            Services, or (ii) a refund of all or part of the Total Contract Amount. Re-Bath has absolute
                            discretion to choose between these two options.
                            YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER REMEDY FOR A WARRANTY CLAIM, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION REMEDY FOR
                            LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR, LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN REASONABLY
                            MITIGATED, OR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY ACTS OF GOD. IN NO EVENT SHALL Re-Bath BE LIABLE FOR
                            INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (SUCH AS, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST
                            PROFITS, LOST SALES, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECT DELAYS, AND INJURIES TO PERSONS OR
                            PROPERTY), EVEN WHERE Re-Bath HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. WHERE,
                            DUE TO OPERATION OF LAW, SUCH DAMAGES CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, THEY ARE EXPRESSLY LIMITED IN
                            AMOUNT TO THE TOTAL CONTRACT AMOUNT. For warranty claims, You agree to prepare the work area
                            at the Project Address in the manner described in the section titled “Customer
                            Responsibilities.”

                        <div>
                            11. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL, AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS. Re-Bath
                            wants to keep You as a customer, and Re-Bath resolves most questions and complaints
                            informally. All claims related to this Contract by Re-Bath or by You, Your agents, insureds
                            or assigns, which You and Re-Bath cannot resolve informally shall proceed to binding
                            arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator under the current applicable rules, procedures,
                            and protocols of JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”) (www.jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration
                            Association (“AAA”) (www.adr.org). You agree that if either JAMS or AAA is unable or
                            unwilling to arbitrate the matter, You and Re-Bath will agree upon a single arbitrator with
                            a nationally recognized arbitration firm to arbitrate the matter. Claims subject to binding
                            arbitration include:
                            a) all claims in any way related to the signing of this arbitration agreement, the validity
                            or scope of this arbitration agreement, or any attempt to set aside this arbitration
                            agreement;
                            b) all federal or state law claims relating in any way to this Contract (including this
                            arbitration agreement), the information You gave Re-Bath before entering into this Contract,
                            and any past agreement or agreements between You and Re-Bath; c) all counterclaims,
                            cross-claims, and third-party claims;
                            d) all common law claims of any kind including claims based upon alleged product defect,
                            contract, tort, fraud, or other intentional torts;
                            e) all claims based upon a violation of any state or federal constitution, statute, or
                            regulation;
                            f) all claims asserted by Re-Bath against You, including claims for money damages to collect
                            any sum Re-Bath claims You owe;
                            g) all claims asserted by You individually against Re-Bath or any of Re-Bath employees,
                            agents, directors, officers, shareholders, managers, members, parent company, or affiliated
                            entities (collectively the "related third parties") or the Re-Bath Installer or
                            Sub-contractor, including claims for money damages and/or equitable or injunctive relief;
                            h) all claims asserted on Your behalf by another person;
                            i) all claims asserted by or on behalf of You as a private attorney general against Re-Bath,
                            related third parties or the Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor;
                            j) all claims arising from or relating directly or indirectly to the disclosure by Re-Bath,
                            related third parties or the Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor of any non-public personal
                            information about You; and
                            k) all other claims related to this Contract whether or not set forth above. If the dispute
                            falls within the jurisdiction of a small claims court the claimant may, at its option,
                            choose to arbitrate or file a small claims action. Any appeal of a judgment from a small
                            claims court shall be resolved by arbitration as provided by this Contract.
                            Binding arbitration means that You waive: (1) any right to a jury trial; (2) any right to
                            bring a lawsuit in a court (other than a small claims court as described above); and (3) any
                            right to seek relief in any other way. An arbitrator will decide any claim not decided by a
                            small claims court. You agree that binding arbitration provides a simple, cost effective
                            method to resolve disputes quickly.
                            You agree that (1) You cannot pursue a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration of
                            any type, (2) no one can pursue a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration of any
                            type on Your behalf, and (3) a Court or arbitrator(s) cannot order class action proceedings
                            under this Contract. You further agree that there shall be no joinder of parties, except for
                            joinder of parties to the transaction covered by this Contract. By agreeing to binding
                            arbitration You and Re-Bath waive any right to bring or participate in a class action
                            lawsuit or class action arbitration regarding any claim.
                            How Arbitration Works:
                            Re-Bath may demand arbitration by sending written notice to You at the address listed in
                            this Contract. You may demand arbitration by sending written notice to Re-Bath at the
                            following address: 13423 Blanco Road #403 San Antonio, TX 78216. The arbitration shall occur
                            in the city or county of the Project Address. Re-Bath shall pay the filing, administrative,
                            hearing, and arbitrator's fees associated with the arbitration. You are not required to
                            reimburse Re-Bath for these expenses even if Re-Bath wins the arbitration. Unless the
                            arbitrator's award or controlling law specifically provides otherwise, You and Re-Bath are

                            expert witness fees. Either party may request that the arbitrator provide a written
                            explanation of the award, consistent with the then current rules, procedures, and protocols
                            of the arbitration entity selected by the parties. Any court having jurisdiction may receive
                            and enforce the arbitrator's award. If You fail to pay Re-Bath in accordance with this
                            Contract, You agree that Re-Bath can recover its reasonable attorneys' fees .The parties
                            agree that this arbitration agreement is made in connection with a transaction involving
                            interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16 (as
                            amended) (“FAA”), governs. If for any reason the Federal Arbitration Act does not apply,
                            then the laws of the State of Texas shall govern this arbitration agreement.

                            disclosure is included in this Contract:
                            KNOW YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE LAW. You are about to enter into a
                            transaction to build a new home or remodel existing residential property. Texas law requires
                            your contractor to provide you with this brief overview of some of your rights,
                            responsibilities, and risks in this transaction.
                            CONVEYANCE TO CONTRACTOR NOT REQUIRED. Your contractor may not require you to convey your
                            real property to your contractor as a condition to the agreement for the construction of
                            improvements on your property.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            KNOW YOUR CONTRACTOR. Before you enter into your agreement for the construction of
                            improvements to your real property, make sure that you have investigated your contractor.
                            Obtain and verify references from other people who have used the contractor for the type and
                            size of construction project on your property.
                            GET IT IN WRITING. Make sure that you have a written agreement with your contractor that
                            includes: (1) a description of the work the contractor is to perform; (2) the required or
                            estimated time for completion of the work; (3) the cost of the work or how the cost will be
                            determined; and (4) the procedure and method of payment, including provisions for statutory
                            retainage and conditions for final payment. If your contractor made a promise, warranty, or
                            representation to you concerning the work the contractor is to perform, make sure that
                            promise, warranty, or representation is specified in the written agreement. An oral promise
                            that is not included in the written agreement may not be enforceable under Texas law.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            READ BEFORE YOU SIGN. Do not sign any document before you have read and understood it. NEVER
                            SIGN A DOCUMENT THAT INCLUDES AN UNTRUE STATEMENT. Take your time in reviewing documents. If
                            you borrow money from a lender to pay for the improvements, you are entitled to have the
                            loan closing documents furnished to you for review at least one business day before the
                            closing. Do not waive this requirement unless a bona fide emergency or another good cause
                            exists, and make sure you understand the documents before you sign them. If you fail to
                            comply with the terms of the documents, you could lose your property. You are entitled to
                            have your own attorney review any documents. If you have any question about the meaning of a
                            document, consult an attorney.
                            GET A LIST OF SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS. Before construction commences, your contractor
                            is required to provide you with a list of the subcontractors and suppliers the contractor
                            intends to use on your project. Your contractor is required to supply updated information on
                            any subcontractors and suppliers added after the list is provided. Your contractor is not
                            required to supply this information if you sign a written waiver of your rights to receive
                            this information.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            MONITOR THE WORK. Lenders and governmental authorities may inspect the work in progress from
                            time to time for their own purposes. These inspections are not intended as quality control
                            inspections. Quality control is a matter for you and your contractor. To ensure that your
                            home is being constructed in accordance with your wishes and specifications, you should
                            inspect the work yourself or have your own independent inspector review the work in
                            progress.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            MONITOR PAYMENTS. If you use a lender, your lender is required to provide you with a
                            periodic statement showing the money disbursed by the lender from the proceeds of your loan.
                            Each time your contractor requests payment from you or your lender for work performed, your
                            contractor is also required to furnish you with a disbursement statement that lists the name
                            and address of each subcontractor or supplier that the contractor intends to pay from the
                            requested funds. Review these statements and make sure that the money is being properly
                            disbursed.
                            CLAIMS BY SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS. Under Texas law, if a subcontractor or supplier who
                            furnishes labor or materials for the construction of improvements on your property is not
                            paid, you may become liable and your property may be subject to a lien for the unpaid
                            amount, even if you have not contracted directly with the subcontractor or supplier. To
                            avoid liability, you should take the following actions:
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            (1) If you receive a written notice from a subcontractor or supplier, you should withhold
                            payment from your contractor for the amount of the claim stated in the notice until the
                            dispute between your contractor and the subcontractor or supplier is resolved. If your
                            lender is disbursing money directly to your contractor, you should immediately provide a
                            copy of the notice to your lender and instruct the lender to withhold payment in the amount
                            of the claim stated in the notice. If you continue to pay the contractor after receiving the
                            written notice without withholding the amount of the claim, you may be liable and your
                            property may be subject to a lien for the amount you failed to withhold.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            (2) During construction and for 30 days after final completion, termination, or abandonment
                            of the contract by the contractor, you should withhold or cause your lender to withhold 10
                            percent of the amount of payments made for the work performed by your contractor. This is
                            sometimes referred to as ‘statutory retainage.’ If you choose not to withhold the 10 percent
                            for at least 30 days after final completion, termination, or abandonment of the contract by
                            the contractor and if a valid claim is timely made by a claimant and your contractor fails
                            to pay the claim, you may be personally liable and your property may be subject to a lien up
                            to the amount that you failed to withhold.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            If a claim is not paid within a certain time period, the claimant is required to file a
                            mechanic's lien affidavit in the real property records in the county where the property is
                            located. A mechanic's lien affidavit is not a lien on your property, but the filing of the
                            affidavit could result in a court imposing a lien on your property if the claimant is
                            successful in litigation to enforce the lien claim. </div>
                        <div>
                            SOME CLAIMS MAY NOT BE VALID. When you receive a written notice of a claim or when a
                            mechanic's lien affidavit is filed on your property, you should know your legal rights and
                            responsibilities regarding the claim. Not all claims are valid. A notice of a claim by a
                            subcontractor or supplier is required to be sent, and the mechanic's lien affidavit is
                            required to be filed, within strict time periods. The notice and the affidavit must contain
                            certain information. All claimants may not fully comply with the legal requirements to
                            collect on a claim. If you have paid the contractor in full before receiving a notice of a
                            claim and have fully complied with the law regarding statutory retainage, you may not be
                            liable for that claim. Accordingly, you should consult your attorney when you receive a
                            written notice of a claim to determine the true extent of your liability or potential
                            liability for that claim.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            OBTAIN A LIEN RELEASE AND A BILLS-PAID AFFIDAVIT. When you receive a notice of claim, do not
                            release withheld funds without obtaining a signed and notarized release of lien and claim
                            from the claimant. You can also reduce the risk of having a claim filed by a subcontractor
                            or supplier by requiring as a condition of each payment made by you or your lender that your
                            contractor furnish you with an affidavit stating that all bills have been paid. Under Texas
                            law, on final completion of the work and before final payment, the contractor is required to
                            furnish you with an affidavit stating that all bills have been paid. If the contractor
                            discloses any unpaid bill in the affidavit, you should withhold payment in the amount of the
                            unpaid bill until you receive a waiver of lien or release from that subcontractor or
                            supplier. </div>
                        <div>
                            OBTAIN TITLE INSURANCE PROTECTION. You may be able to obtain a title insurance policy to
                            insure that the title to your property and the existing improvements on your property are
                            free from liens claimed by subcontractors and suppliers. If your policy is issued before the
                            improvements are completed and covers the value of the improvements to be completed, you
                            should obtain, on the completion of the improvements and as a condition of your final
                            payment, a ‘completion of improvements' policy endorsement. This endorsement will protect
                            your property from liens claimed by subcontractors and suppliers that may arise from the
                            date the original title policy is issued to the date of the endorsement. </div>

                            PRICE CALCULATIONS. If this Contract includes Goods and related Bathroom Remodeling Services
                            sold on a LUMP SUM BASIS. The Price includes the total amount of Goods required by Re-Bath
                            to fulfill the Contract (including surplus materials and overages) (together the “Estimated
                            Product”) and the Bathroom Remodeling Services required based upon this total amount of
                            Goods. For instance, a 120 square foot room may require 140 square feet of carpet, and the
                            Price would include Bathroom Remodeling Services based upon the 140 square feet of carpet.
                            The total amount of Estimated Product is based upon the total Goods recommended by the
                            Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor, based on the Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor's
                            assessment of unique characteristics of Your project. If any usable Goods are left over,
                            Re-Bath may, at its discretion, initiate a Price adjustment. Re-Bath will not adjust the
                            Total Contract Amount for the related Bathroom Remodeling Services. By signing this Contract
                            You acknowledge You are aware of Your project area measurements and the amount of Estimated
                            Product, and that the Estimated Product may exceed Your actual project area. </div>

                            LEAD SAFE INFORMATION. Federal and applicable state laws require that You be provided with a

                            Information for Families, Child Care Providers and Schools. By signing this Contract, You
                            acknowledge having received a copy of this information pamphlet before work began informing
                            You of the potential risk of the lead hazard exposure from renovation activity performed in
                            Your dwelling unit or facility. A copy of the pamphlet is available at the following

                            by BINDING ARBITRATION. You and Re-Bath GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to enforce this
                            Contract (EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to SMALL CLAIMS COURT). A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR
                            will determine Re-Bath and Your rights and NOT a judge or jury. You and Re-Bath are entitled
                            to a FAIR HEARING. BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES
                            APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are
                            subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. FOR MORE DETAILS: Review the sections titled

                            by You.

                            will obtain any and all licenses, registrations, certifications, and permits (“Local
                            Requirements”) necessary to perform the Bathroom Remodeling Services at the Project Address,
                            unless otherwise required by law or where Re-Bath elects to use a third-party service. You
                            agree to pay any fees associated with the Local Requirements and to cooperate in any
                            required inspection or permitting process. The Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor, and not
                            Re-Bath, is responsible for performing the Bathroom Remodeling Services in compliance with
                            applicable safety rules, building codes, zoning ordinances, and other regulations (“Local
                            Regulations”). You are responsible for any violations of the Local Regulations that exist at
                            the time You sign this Contract. This Contract creates no obligation to correct these
                            pre-existing violations. Any change in the Local Regulations may require a Change Order and
                            may result in an increase in the Total Contract Amount. Neither Re-Bath nor Re-Bath
                            Installer or Sub-contractor will perform any additional work after completion of the
                            Bathroom Remodeling Services due to changes in the Local Regulations.

                        <div>
                            6. TERMINATION. If You breach this Contract or decline a reasonable Change Order request,
                            Re-Bath may immediately terminate this Contract without further obligation. In the event of
                            such termination, You agree to pay Re-Bath the costs of materials, labor, expenses, and
                            services provided by Re-Bath in connection with the Bathroom Remodeling Services through the
                            date of termination, plus any other amounts set forth in this Contract or allowed under
                            applicable law. If terminated or rescinded, Re-Bath has no obligation to return the Project
                            Address to the original condition. If Re-Bath terminates or rescinds the contract before
                            delivering Goods or beginning the Bathroom Remodeling Services, then Re-Bath will return the
                            portion of the Total Contract Amount paid by You without further costs or obligation to You
                            or Re-Bath.

                            7. YOUR WARRANTY TO Re-Bath AGAINST VIOLATIONS OF EASEMENTS, COVENANTS, AND THIRD PARTY
                            RIGHTS. You warrant that performance of the Bathroom Remodeling Services will not violate
                            any existing real property easement, covenant, historic district regulations, homeowner's
                            association rule or rights of third parties holding an interest in the Project Address or
                            otherwise, and that You have the rights and authority to enter into this Contract.

                        <div>
                            8. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES. You agree:
                            a) To Pay Re-Bath or Lowe’s Home Improvement or other party if authorized in writing by
                            Re-Bath for any Bathroom Remodeling Services, even if Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor
                            provides a new Contract or Change Order for your review and signature. This Contract is
                            solely between You and Re-Bath.
                            b) To Locate Lines and Hazards. Before Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor begins Bathroom
                            Remodeling Services, You will identify and mark the location of utility lines, for example
                            electrical, plumbing, and gas lines, and property lines that could impact the Bathroom
                            Remodeling Services. Prior to the Bathroom Remodeling, You will identify any pre-existing
                            physical or environmental hazards, building code violations or other legal encumbrances that
                            could affect the Bathroom Remodeling Services. You are responsible for any delays or
                            interference to the Bathroom Remodeling caused by You or any third party under Your
                            direction or control.
                            c) To Ensure Compliance with Smoke Alarm and Carbon Monoxide Detector Requirements. Prior to
                            the start of the Bathroom Remodeling Services, You will ensure the Project Address has all
                            necessary carbon monoxide detectors and smoke alarms (“Detectors”) needed for the Re-Bath
                            Installer or Sub-contractor to obtain the necessary permits and complete the Bathroom
                            Remodeling Services. You are solely responsible for the proper number, placement, type,
                            functioning, operation, Bathroom Remodeling, testing, as per the manufacturers’
                            specifications, and maintenance of any Detectors required by Local Regulations. Failure to
                            meet Federal, state or local Detector requirements, if any, will be considered an
                            Undisclosed Condition.
                            d) To Provide a Safe and Proper Working Environment. Before and during the Bathroom
                            Remodeling Services, You will ensure that work areas are free of vermin, pre-existing
                            physical or environmental hazards, and violations of Local Regulations. You will allow the
                            Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor to have access to work areas and restrooms. You will
                            provide climate control, where applicable, and electricity to the work areas. You agree not
                            to allow unattended minors at the Project Address during the Bathroom Remodeling Services.
                            You agree to control and keep pets away from work areas. You agree to keep posted permits on
                            display at all times. If You or someone You control interferes with the Bathroom Remodeling
                            Services, Re-Bath may charge You for storage, transportation, or other resulting charges.
                            e) To Sign the Certificate of Completion. You will sign a Completion Certificate upon
                            satisfactory completion of the Bathroom Remodeling Services.
                            f) Not to Assign or Transfer this Contract. You cannot give Your rights under this Contract
                            to anyone else. g) To Promptly Notify Re-Bath of a Claim. If you have a claim that is in any
                            way related to this Contract, You must make that claim to Re-Bath within thirty (30)
                            calendar days of when you knew or should have known of a problem. Re-Bath will attempt
                            resolution of any claim(s) within sixty (60) calendar days of receiving Your notice. Re-Bath
                            will allow Limited Warranty transfers on a case by case basis to a new home owner within 1
                            year of completion of this Contract. “Completion” refers to the completion of remodeling,
                            customer signature on Certificate of Completion and full payment received.
                            h) That You Are Responsible If You Choose to Help. IF YOU CHOOSE TO HELP, YOU ASSUME THE
                            RISK AND THE FULL LIABILITY OF PHYSICALLY ASSISTING WITH DELIVERY OF THE GOODS OR WITH
                            PERFORMANCE OF THE Bathroom Remodeling SERVICES.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            9. LIMITED WARRANTY. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, Re-Bath WARRANTS THE
                            WORKMANSHIP OF THE Bathroom Remodeling SERVICES FOR ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE COMPLETION DATE
                            (THE "WARRANTY PERIOD") UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN DESCRIPTION OF LIMITED LIFETIME
                            WARRANTY GIVEN TO CUSTOMER PRE OR POST COMPLETION OF CONTRACT. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER
                            DAMAGE CAUSED BY ACTS OF GOD, Bathroom Remodeling OR REPAIRS MADE BY PERSONS OTHER THAN
                            Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor, OR ABUSE, MISUSE, NEGLECT OR NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.
                            GOODS ARE COVERED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE MANUFACTURER’S WARRANTY, IF ANY. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY
                            GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.
                            Re-Bath WARRANTY FOR Bathroom Remodeling SERVICES IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS
                            OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
                            FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. For any claim related to this Contract, You can only seek
                            recourse from Re-Bath or the Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor; no parent or affiliate of
                            Re-Bath shall have any liability under this Contract. You must give Re-Bath written notice
                            within the Warranty Period of any warranty claim. Your only remedy for a warranty claim is
                            either (i) for Re-Bath to have the Bathroom Remodeling Services performed again, including
                            any necessary repair and replacement of Goods, to correct the defective Bathroom Remodeling
                            Services, or (ii) a refund of all or part of the Total Contract Amount. Re-Bath has absolute
                            discretion to choose between these two options.
                            YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER REMEDY FOR A WARRANTY CLAIM, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION REMEDY FOR
                            LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR, LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN REASONABLY
                            MITIGATED, OR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY ACTS OF GOD. IN NO EVENT SHALL Re-Bath BE LIABLE FOR
                            INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (SUCH AS, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST
                            PROFITS, LOST SALES, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECT DELAYS, AND INJURIES TO PERSONS OR
                            PROPERTY), EVEN WHERE Re-Bath HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. WHERE,
                            DUE TO OPERATION OF LAW, SUCH DAMAGES CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, THEY ARE EXPRESSLY LIMITED IN
                            AMOUNT TO THE TOTAL CONTRACT AMOUNT. For warranty claims, You agree to prepare the work area
                            at the Project Address in the manner described in the section titled “Customer
                            Responsibilities.”

                            11. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL, AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS. Re-Bath
                            wants to keep You as a customer, and Re-Bath resolves most questions and complaints
                            informally. All claims related to this Contract by Re-Bath or by You, Your agents, insureds
                            or assigns, which You and Re-Bath cannot resolve informally shall proceed to binding
                            arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator under the current applicable rules, procedures,
                            and protocols of JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”) (www.jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration
                            Association (“AAA”) (www.adr.org). You agree that if either JAMS or AAA is unable or
                            unwilling to arbitrate the matter, You and Re-Bath will agree upon a single arbitrator with
                            a nationally recognized arbitration firm to arbitrate the matter. Claims subject to binding
                            arbitration include:
                            a) all claims in any way related to the signing of this arbitration agreement, the validity
                            or scope of this arbitration agreement, or any attempt to set aside this arbitration
                            agreement;
                            b) all federal or state law claims relating in any way to this Contract (including this
                            arbitration agreement), the information You gave Re-Bath before entering into this Contract,
                            and any past agreement or agreements between You and Re-Bath; c) all counterclaims,
                            cross-claims, and third-party claims;
                            d) all common law claims of any kind including claims based upon alleged product defect,
                            contract, tort, fraud, or other intentional torts;
                            e) all claims based upon a violation of any state or federal constitution, statute, or
                            regulation;
                            f) all claims asserted by Re-Bath against You, including claims for money damages to collect
                            any sum Re-Bath claims You owe;
                            g) all claims asserted by You individually against Re-Bath or any of Re-Bath employees,
                            agents, directors, officers, shareholders, managers, members, parent company, or affiliated
                            entities (collectively the "related third parties") or the Re-Bath Installer or
                            Sub-contractor, including claims for money damages and/or equitable or injunctive relief;
                            h) all claims asserted on Your behalf by another person;
                            i) all claims asserted by or on behalf of You as a private attorney general against Re-Bath,
                            related third parties or the Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor;
                            j) all claims arising from or relating directly or indirectly to the disclosure by Re-Bath,
                            related third parties or the Re-Bath Installer or Sub-contractor of any non-public personal
                            information about You; and
                            k) all other claims related to this Contract whether or not set forth above. If the dispute
                            falls within the jurisdiction of a small claims court the claimant may, at its option,
                            choose to arbitrate or file a small claims action. Any appeal of a judgment from a small
                            claims court shall be resolved by arbitration as provided by this Contract.
                            Binding arbitration means that You waive: (1) any right to a jury trial; (2) any right to
                            bring a lawsuit in a court (other than a small claims court as described above); and (3) any
                            right to seek relief in any other way. An arbitrator will decide any claim not decided by a
                            small claims court. You agree that binding arbitration provides a simple, cost effective
                            method to resolve disputes quickly.
                            You agree that (1) You cannot pursue a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration of
                            any type, (2) no one can pursue a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration of any
                            type on Your behalf, and (3) a Court or arbitrator(s) cannot order class action proceedings
                            under this Contract. You further agree that there shall be no joinder of parties, except for
                            joinder of parties to the transaction covered by this Contract. By agreeing to binding
                            arbitration You and Re-Bath waive any right to bring or participate in a class action
                            lawsuit or class action arbitration regarding any claim.
                            How Arbitration Works:
                            Re-Bath may demand arbitration by sending written notice to You at the address listed in
                            this Contract. You may demand arbitration by sending written notice to Re-Bath at the
                            following address: 13423 Blanco Road #403 San Antonio, TX 78216. The arbitration shall occur
                            in the city or county of the Project Address. Re-Bath shall pay the filing, administrative,
                            hearing, and arbitrator's fees associated with the arbitration. You are not required to
                            reimburse Re-Bath for these expenses even if Re-Bath wins the arbitration. Unless the
                            arbitrator's award or controlling law specifically provides otherwise, You and Re-Bath are
                            each responsible for their own attorneys' fees and other expenses, such as witness and
                            expert witness fees. Either party may request that the arbitrator provide a written
                            explanation of the award, consistent with the then current rules, procedures, and protocols
                            of the arbitration entity selected by the parties. Any court having jurisdiction may receive
                            and enforce the arbitrator's award. If You fail to pay Re-Bath in accordance with this
                            Contract, You agree that Re-Bath can recover its reasonable attorneys' fees .The parties
                            agree that this arbitration agreement is made in connection with a transaction involving
                            interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16 (as
                            amended) (“FAA”), governs. If for any reason the Federal Arbitration Act does not apply,
                            then the laws of the State of Texas shall govern this arbitration agreement.
                        </div>

                            7. DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. In accordance with Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 53.255, the following
                            disclosure is included in this Contract:
                            KNOW YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE LAW. You are about to enter into a
                            transaction to build a new home or remodel existing residential property. Texas law requires
                            your contractor to provide you with this brief overview of some of your rights,
                            responsibilities, and risks in this transaction.
                            CONVEYANCE TO CONTRACTOR NOT REQUIRED. Your contractor may not require you to convey your
                            real property to your contractor as a condition to the agreement for the construction of
                            improvements on your property.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            KNOW YOUR CONTRACTOR. Before you enter into your agreement for the construction of
                            improvements to your real property, make sure that you have investigated your contractor.
                            Obtain and verify references from other people who have used the contractor for the type and
                            size of construction project on your property.
                            GET IT IN WRITING. Make sure that you have a written agreement with your contractor that
                            includes: (1) a description of the work the contractor is to perform; (2) the required or
                            estimated time for completion of the work; (3) the cost of the work or how the cost will be
                            determined; and (4) the procedure and method of payment, including provisions for statutory
                            retainage and conditions for final payment. If your contractor made a promise, warranty, or
                            representation to you concerning the work the contractor is to perform, make sure that
                            promise, warranty, or representation is specified in the written agreement. An oral promise
                            that is not included in the written agreement may not be enforceable under Texas law.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            READ BEFORE YOU SIGN. Do not sign any document before you have read and understood it. NEVER
                            SIGN A DOCUMENT THAT INCLUDES AN UNTRUE STATEMENT. Take your time in reviewing documents. If
                            you borrow money from a lender to pay for the improvements, you are entitled to have the
                            loan closing documents furnished to you for review at least one business day before the
                            closing. Do not waive this requirement unless a bona fide emergency or another good cause
                            exists, and make sure you understand the documents before you sign them. If you fail to
                            comply with the terms of the documents, you could lose your property. You are entitled to
                            have your own attorney review any documents. If you have any question about the meaning of a
                            document, consult an attorney.
                            GET A LIST OF SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS. Before construction commences, your contractor
                            is required to provide you with a list of the subcontractors and suppliers the contractor
                            intends to use on your project. Your contractor is required to supply updated information on
                            any subcontractors and suppliers added after the list is provided. Your contractor is not
                            required to supply this information if you sign a written waiver of your rights to receive
                            this information.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            MONITOR THE WORK. Lenders and governmental authorities may inspect the work in progress from
                            time to time for their own purposes. These inspections are not intended as quality control
                            inspections. Quality control is a matter for you and your contractor. To ensure that your
                            home is being constructed in accordance with your wishes and specifications, you should
                            inspect the work yourself or have your own independent inspector review the work in
                            progress.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            MONITOR PAYMENTS. If you use a lender, your lender is required to provide you with a
                            periodic statement showing the money disbursed by the lender from the proceeds of your loan.
                            Each time your contractor requests payment from you or your lender for work performed, your
                            contractor is also required to furnish you with a disbursement statement that lists the name
                            and address of each subcontractor or supplier that the contractor intends to pay from the
                            requested funds. Review these statements and make sure that the money is being properly
                            disbursed.
                            CLAIMS BY SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS. Under Texas law, if a subcontractor or supplier who
                            furnishes labor or materials for the construction of improvements on your property is not
                            paid, you may become liable and your property may be subject to a lien for the unpaid
                            amount, even if you have not contracted directly with the subcontractor or supplier. To
                            avoid liability, you should take the following actions:
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            (1) If you receive a written notice from a subcontractor or supplier, you should withhold
                            payment from your contractor for the amount of the claim stated in the notice until the
                            dispute between your contractor and the subcontractor or supplier is resolved. If your
                            lender is disbursing money directly to your contractor, you should immediately provide a
                            copy of the notice to your lender and instruct the lender to withhold payment in the amount
                            of the claim stated in the notice. If you continue to pay the contractor after receiving the
                            written notice without withholding the amount of the claim, you may be liable and your
                            property may be subject to a lien for the amount you failed to withhold.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            (2) During construction and for 30 days after final completion, termination, or abandonment
                            of the contract by the contractor, you should withhold or cause your lender to withhold 10
                            percent of the amount of payments made for the work performed by your contractor. This is
                            sometimes referred to as ‘statutory retainage.’ If you choose not to withhold the 10 percent
                            for at least 30 days after final completion, termination, or abandonment of the contract by
                            the contractor and if a valid claim is timely made by a claimant and your contractor fails
                            to pay the claim, you may be personally liable and your property may be subject to a lien up
                            to the amount that you failed to withhold.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            If a claim is not paid within a certain time period, the claimant is required to file a
                            mechanic's lien affidavit in the real property records in the county where the property is
                            located. A mechanic's lien affidavit is not a lien on your property, but the filing of the
                            affidavit could result in a court imposing a lien on your property if the claimant is
                            successful in litigation to enforce the lien claim. </div>
                        <div>
                            SOME CLAIMS MAY NOT BE VALID. When you receive a written notice of a claim or when a
                            mechanic's lien affidavit is filed on your property, you should know your legal rights and
                            responsibilities regarding the claim. Not all claims are valid. A notice of a claim by a
                            subcontractor or supplier is required to be sent, and the mechanic's lien affidavit is
                            required to be filed, within strict time periods. The notice and the affidavit must contain
                            certain information. All claimants may not fully comply with the legal requirements to
                            collect on a claim. If you have paid the contractor in full before receiving a notice of a
                            claim and have fully complied with the law regarding statutory retainage, you may not be
                            liable for that claim. Accordingly, you should consult your attorney when you receive a
                            written notice of a claim to determine the true extent of your liability or potential
                            liability for that claim.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            OBTAIN A LIEN RELEASE AND A BILLS-PAID AFFIDAVIT. When you receive a notice of claim, do not
                            release withheld funds without obtaining a signed and notarized release of lien and claim
                            from the claimant. You can also reduce the risk of having a claim filed by a subcontractor
                            or supplier by requiring as a condition of each payment made by you or your lender that your
                            contractor furnish you with an affidavit stating that all bills have been paid. Under Texas
                            law, on final completion of the work and before final payment, the contractor is required to
                            furnish you with an affidavit stating that all bills have been paid. If the contractor
                            discloses any unpaid bill in the affidavit, you should withhold payment in the amount of the
                            unpaid bill until you receive a waiver of lien or release from that subcontractor or
                            supplier. </div>
                        <div>
                            OBTAIN TITLE INSURANCE PROTECTION. You may be able to obtain a title insurance policy to
                            insure that the title to your property and the existing improvements on your property are
                            free from liens claimed by subcontractors and suppliers. If your policy is issued before the
                            improvements are completed and covers the value of the improvements to be completed, you
                            should obtain, on the completion of the improvements and as a condition of your final
                            payment, a ‘completion of improvements' policy endorsement. This endorsement will protect
                            your property from liens claimed by subcontractors and suppliers that may arise from the
                            date the original title policy is issued to the date of the endorsement. </div>
